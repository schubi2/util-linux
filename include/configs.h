/**
 * ul_configs_file_list - Evaluting a list of sorted configuration filenames which have to be handled
 *                        in the correct order.
 *
 * @file_list: List of filenames which have to be parsed in that order
 * @project: name of the project used as subdirectory, can be NULL
 * @etc_subdir: absolute directory path for user changed configuration files, can be NULL (default "/etc").
 * @usr_subdir: absolute directory path of vendor defined settings (often "/usr/lib").
 * @config_name: basename of the configuration file. If it is NULL, drop-ins without a main configuration file will be parsed only. 
 * @config_suffix: suffix of the configuration file. Can also be NULL.
 *
 * Returns the length of the file_list, or -ENOMEM, or -ENOTEMPTY if config_name is NULL
 *
 * Example:
 * int count = 0;
 * struct list_head *file_list;
 *
 * count = ul_configs_file_list(&file_list,
 *                              "foo",
 *                              "/etc",
